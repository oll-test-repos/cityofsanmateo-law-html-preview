                <p>WHEREAS, on September 5, 2023, the City Council held a study session regarding potential amendments to San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 2.80 "Contributions and Loans to City Candidate Campaigns" and provided direction regarding voluntary expenditure limits; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the adoption of SMMC <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/2.80.055" title="2.80.055 VOLUNTARY EXPENDITURE LIMIT.">Section 2.80.055</a> "Voluntary Expenditure Limit" will allow City Council candidates an opportunity to voluntarily agree to expenditure limits in exchange for specified benefits; and</p>

                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>

The agreement to voluntarily limit campaign expenditures shall pertain to all expenditures incurred by the candidate or the candidate's committee in support of their candidacy and shall include all such expenditures that a candidate or candidate's committee is required to report pursuant to the California Political Reform Act of 1974, as amended, whether those expenditures are made before or after the filing of nomination papers.</p>

This increase shall be the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) computed by reference to the CPI as indexed from a base year that commences in November 2023 (by way of example, on January 1, 2026, the City Clerk will adjust the voluntary expenditure ceiling amounts by determining the increase in CPI from November 2023 — November 2025). The increase shall be rounded to the nearest hundred dollars ($100). The City Clerk shall publish the adjusted expenditure ceiling amounts no later than February 1st of each even-numbered year.</p>
