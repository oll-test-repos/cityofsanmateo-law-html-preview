                <p>WHEREAS, on September 5, 2023, the City Council held a study session regarding potential amendments to San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 2.80 "Contributions and Loans to City Candidate Campaigns" and provided direction regarding voluntary expenditure limits; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the adoption of SMMC <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/2.80.055" title="2.80.055 VOLUNTARY EXPENDITURE LIMIT.">Section 2.80.055</a> "Voluntary Expenditure Limit" will allow City Council candidates an opportunity to voluntarily agree to expenditure limits in exchange for specified benefits; and</p>

                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>

                <h4 class="h6 text--bold quote">2.80.055 VOLUNTARY EXPENDITURE LIMIT.</h4>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Each candidate for election to the City Council in November 2024, and for each City Council election thereafter, shall, prior to the time they file their nomination papers with the city clerk, advise the city clerk in writing on a form provided by the City whether or not the candidate will opt to voluntarily limit their campaign expenditures in accordance with the voluntary campaign expenditure limits set forth in this section and by resolution. The agreement to voluntarily limit campaign expenditures shall pertain to all expenditures incurred by the candidate or the candidate's committee in support of their candidacy and shall include all such expenditures that a candidate or candidate's committee is required to report pursuant to the California Political Reform Act of 1974, as amended, whether those expenditures are made before or after the filing of nomination papers.</p>

The candidate shall thereafter be relieved of abiding by the expenditure limit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Candidates who agree to abide by the voluntary campaign expenditure limit shall receive the following benefits and incentives at no cost to themselves:</p>

The City Clerk shall publish on its website and in a newspaper of general circulation the expenditure ceiling amount for each district, rounded to the nearest hundred dollars ($100), no later than sixty (60) business days following adoption of the ordinance from which this Section is derived.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Beginning on January 1, 2026, the City Clerk shall in even-numbered years increase the expenditure ceiling amounts based upon a finding that the cost of living in the immediate San Francisco Bay Area, as shown on the CPI for all items in the San Francisco Bay Area as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics, has increased. This increase shall be the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) computed by reference to the CPI as indexed from a base year that commences in November 2023 (by way of example, on January 1, 2026, the City Clerk will adjust the voluntary expenditure ceiling amounts by determining the increase in CPI from November 2023 — November 2025). The increase shall be rounded to the nearest hundred dollars ($100). The City Clerk shall publish the adjusted expenditure ceiling amounts no later than February 1st of each even-numbered year.</p>
