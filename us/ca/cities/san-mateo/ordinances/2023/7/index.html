A finding of "offered for Sale" in violation of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7.41" title="Chapter 7.41 TOBACCO RETAILER PERMIT">this Chapter</a> will be made if Tobacco Products are either actually Sold and/or displayed in the retail establishment, or if advertisements offering to Sell Tobacco Products are visible to customers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Fine Procedures. Notice of the fine shall be served on the Tobacco Retailer by certified mail.
