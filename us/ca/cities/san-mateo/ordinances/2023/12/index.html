                <p>WHEREAS, under the Housing Accountability Act, housing development projects, as defined, are subject to design review standards and criteria provided that they are objective in nature and not subjective; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City of San Mateo (City) desires to update its existing design standards for multi-family residential and residential mixed-use developments to offer objective design criteria for streamlined review of projects; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City's draft 2023-2031 Housing Element identifies programs to further streamline processing for projects, including the adoption of objective design standards and the increase of Zoning Administrator approval authority to include projects with 6 to 25 residential dwelling units; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City has conducted extensive community outreach over the last three years regarding objective design standards, including three public outreach meetings and two Planning Commission study sessions; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in accordance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, Section 15061(b)(3), adoption of this ordinance is covered by the "common sense exemption" in that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential to cause a significant effect on the environment. Here, it can be seen with certainty that the proposed amendments to create objective design standards and a streamlined review process for small projects up to twenty-five (25) residential dwelling units subject to objective design standards would not cause a physical change in the environment and therefore would not have a significant effect on the environment. Proposals for multi-family or residential mixed-use development will be considered as individual projects and will be evaluated pursuant to CEQA at the time of application submittal; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on October 24, 2023, the Planning Commission held a duly noticed public hearing, received all written and oral public comments, and recommended that the City Council approve the proposed ordinance.</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                <div class="p--section" data-ref-path="§1"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="1">Section 1.</h2> <p>Legislative Findings.</p></div>
                <p>At a duly noticed public hearing, the City Council of the City of San Mateo reviewed and considered the accompanying staff report and attachments thereto, the exemption from environmental review, together with comments received during the public review process, and hereby finds and determines that the proposed ordinance is consistent with the adopted General Plan in that it supports successful completion of projects that implement and achieve the General Plan's stated goals and policies.</p>
