                <p>WHEREAS, the City of San Mateo's (City) Climate Action Plan recommends the City review local amendments to the California Energy Code and the Green Building Standards Code to promote building electrification, energy efficiency, and electric vehicle infrastructure; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, California Energy Code and Green Building Standards Code, 2022 Edition, were adopted by the City of San Mateo on November 7, 2022 with local amendments to require all-electric new construction and electric-readiness and electric appliances during residential building remodels; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, due to a federal court decision, in early 2024, the City suspended enforcement of local amendments that prohibited the installation of gas infrastructure; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, this presented an opportunity to replace the City's reach code to encourage sustainable new construction; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the proposed Ordinance amends the California Energy Code to require energy compliance margins for newly constructed buildings and require electric-readiness when gas infrastructure is installed; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the proposed Ordinance appeals local amendments to the California Green Building Code that are unenforceable due to the federal court decision; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the proposed Ordinance amends the California Green Building Code to make a minor edit to the electric-readiness requirements to promote consistency with the 2022 Energy Code electric-readiness requirements for new construction; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=HSC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+HSC" title="">California Health and Safety Code</a> Sections <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17922" title="">17922</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958" title="">17958</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958.5" title="">17958.5</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958.7" title="">17958.7</a>, and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=18941.5" title="">18941.5</a> authorizes the City to make local amendments to the California Energy Code and Green Building Standards Code upon express findings that the local amendments are reasonably necessary due to local climatic, geographical, or topographical conditions; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, concurrent with this Ordinance, the City Council of the City of San Mateo has adopted a resolution adopting express findings in support of local amendments to the California Energy Code and Green Building Standards Code, 2022 Edition; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PRC&amp;sectionNum=25402.1" title="">Public Resources Code Section 25402.1(h)</a>2 and Section 10-106 of the Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Standards) establish a process which allows local adoption of energy standards that are more stringent than the statewide Standards, provided that such local standards are cost effective, and the California Energy Commission finds that the standards will require building to be designed to consume no more energy than permitted by the California Energy Code; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, staff has reviewed the cost effectiveness studies prepared by the California Statewide Codes and Standards Reach Code Program and associated study data and find them sufficient to illustrate compliance with the requirements set forth under California Administrative Code Chapter 10-106; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, that such modifications will result in designs that consume less energy than they would under the 2022 State Energy Code through the California Statewide Codes and Standards Reach Code Program, has performed cost effectiveness analyses as required by the California Energy Commission for the local amendments to the California Energy Code contained in this Ordinance which is hereby incorporated by reference; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, based upon these analyses, the San Mateo City Council finds that the local amendments to the California Energy Code contained in the Ordinance have at least one cost effective pathway and will require buildings to be designed to consume no more energy than permitted by the California Energy Code.</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
