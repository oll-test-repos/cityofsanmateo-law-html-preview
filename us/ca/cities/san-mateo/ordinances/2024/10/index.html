                <p>WHEREAS, on May 18, 2020, the City Council of the City of San Mateo adopted Resolution No. 47 (2020) for the purpose of submitting a proposed ordinance to amend the General Plan by extending for ten years the expiration date for certain voter-enacted policies limiting building heights, residential densities, and nonresidential building intensities, as specified ("Measure Y"); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on November 3, 2020, the voters of the City of San Mateo approved Measure Y, which extended through 2030 certain General Plan policies enacted by Measure P in 2004, which in turn amended and extended the 1991 voter initiative Measure H; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on March 18, 2024, the City Council of the City of San Mateo adopted Strive San Mateo General Plan 2040, which sets forth the community's aspirations for the City through 2040, and which plans for specified growth and change in the City primarily focused within ten study areas; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, under state law, any change to Measure Y is subject to voter approval; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City Council desires to submit a measure to the voters of San Mateo to fully allow the heights, densities and intensities permitted under General Plan 2040; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the proposed measure would maintain the height, density, and intensity limits of Measure Y throughout the City of San Mateo, except for ten study areas where growth would remain restricted but subject to higher height, density, and intensity limits than Measure Y, as specified in General Plan 2040 approved by the City Council; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the proposed measure would maintain the height, density, and intensity limits of Measure Y in the majority of the City of San Mateo, as identified on a map that is an exhibit to the measure and subject to voter approval; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the proposed measure would maintain existing heights and densities on residential neighborhoods, with a focus on planning for new development in the downtown, near Caltrain stations, and along transit corridors, all as specified in General Plan 2040.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE, THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO DO ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                <div class="p--section" data-ref-path="§1"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="1">Section 1.</h2> <p>The Land Use Element of the General Plan, attached hereto as Attachment 1 and incorporated by reference, is hereby approved.  The Land Use Element may be modified without voter approval through the general plan amendment process set forth in the City Charter and state law,</p></div>
                <p>except that voter approval shall be required to modify the density ranges, intensity or FAR, or building heights that correspond to each designation in Table LU-1 (Land Use Designations).</p>
                <div class="p--section" data-ref-path="§2"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="2">Section 2.</h2> <p>New land use designations may be created, but no new land use designations may be authorized with density ranges, intensity or FAR, or building heights greater than those set forth in Table LU-1. The land use designation for any particular parcel in Figure LU-1 (Land Use Map) may be changed through the general plan amendment process set forth in the City Charter and state law, provided that no increase in allowed density, intensity, or FAR shall be permitted on that parcel without voter approval, except as specified in Section 5 (Specific Properties).  The Land Use Map identifying individual parcels is attached hereto as Attachment 1A and incorporated by reference.</p></div>
                <div class="p--section" data-ref-path="§3"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="3">Section 3.</h2> <p>Appendix A to the Land Use Element of the General Plan, attached hereto as Attachment 2 and incorporated by reference, is hereby approved.

                <div class="p--section" data-ref-path="§4"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="4">Section 4.</h2> <p>Measure Y, attached hereto as Attachment 3 and incorporated by reference, is hereby repealed in its entirety.</p></div>
                <div class="p--section" data-ref-path="§5"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="5">Section 5.</h2> <p>Specific Properties.</p></div>
                <p>Notwithstanding Section 2, the land use designation for the properties listed in Table 5 may be changed without voter approval to allow a maximum of the height, density, or intensity shown in the Proposed Land Use column below, as applicable, subject to the general plan amendment review process as set forth in the City Charter and state law. The City makes no commitment to approval of the Proposed Land Uses and retains full discretion to approve or disapprove the Proposed Land Uses following completion of the environmental review process, without limitation or consideration of this section.</p>
