                <p>WHEREAS, pursuant to the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&amp;sectionNum=SEC.%207.&amp;article=XI" title="">California Constitution, Article XI, section 7</a>; <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;sectionNum=37100" title="">California Government Code Section 37100</a> and other applicable law, the City Council of the City of San Mateo ("City Council") may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary and other ordinances, resolutions and other regulations not in conflict with general laws; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B), preserves local government zoning authority as it relates to location and siting of wireless communication facilities, but limits local regulations in three key ways: (1) a local ordinance may not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; (2) a local ordinance may not prohibit or effectively prohibit service; and (3) a local ordinance may not regulate based on environmental impacts from radio frequency emissions; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 253 prohibits state and local requirements that prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity's ability to provide any telecommunication service but preserves the authority of state and local governments to manage the public right-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PUC&amp;sectionNum=7901" title="">Section 7901 of the California Public Utilities Code</a> grants telephone corporations the limited right to use the public right-of-way to the extent necessary to provide services to their customers in a manner that does not incommode the public's use of the public right-of-way; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PUC&amp;sectionNum=7901.1" title="">Section 7901.1 of the California Public Utilities Code</a> bolsters the rights reserved to California local governments under Section 7901 and affirms local authority to manage, on a nondiscriminatory basis, the time, place and manner in which telephone corporations access the public right-of-way and deploy their facilities; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, since the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, significant changes have occurred in federal and state laws that affect local authority over personal wireless service facilities; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on July 16, 2018, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2018-5, which added <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">Chapter 17.10</a> to the San Mateo Municipal Code and regulated wireless communications facilities in the public right-of-way; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on June 21, 2021, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2021-18, which amended various provisions in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">Chapter 17.10</a> in response to contemporaneous changes in law and technologies, including a new <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10.120" title="17.10.120 Review of Ordinance">Section 17.10.120</a> ("Review of Ordinance") that authorized the City Council to "amend . . . Chapter [17.10] or [the City's] rules or policies by resolution after a change to the FCC's regulations or standards, or any applicable state or federal laws"; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, given the rapid and substantial changes in applicable state laws and FCC regulations since the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2021-18, the active and effective federal prohibition on reasonable moratorium ordinances to allow local public agencies to study these changes and develop appropriate responses and the significant adverse consequences for noncompliance with these changes in applicable law, and in response to practical experience processing applications for wireless facilities under the San Mateo Municipal Code, the City Council desires to amend <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 17.10</a> by adopting this Ordinance NO. 2024-11 (this "Ordinance") to allow the City greater flexibility and responsiveness to these federal and state laws in order to preserve the City's traditional authority to the maximum extent practicable; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, amending <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 17.10</a> by adopting this Ordinance will allow the City Council to quickly and efficiently adopt administrative policies that provide clear procedures for wireless communications facilities bolster the City's policies and regulations concerning public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic character of the City; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, consolidating all its regulations for wireless communications facilities in the public right-of-way into a single policy will tend to make the regulations easier to locate, understand and apply for all stakeholders; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, amending <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 17.10</a> by adopting this Ordinance neither materially limits a person's ability to provide or receive wireless communications services nor creates unfair competition among wireless telecommunications service providers; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, amending <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 17.10</a> by adopting this Ordinance will, to the extent permitted by federal and California state law, protect and promote public health, safety, and welfare, and also balance the benefits that flow from robust, advanced wireless services with the City's local values, which includes without limitation the aesthetic character of the City, its neighborhoods and community; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the San Mateo Sustainability and Infrastructure Commission considered the proposed Ordinance at a duly noticed public hearing on October 23, 2024, and by a vote of 4-0 recommended the City Council approve the proposed Ordinance to amend <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 17.10</a>; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on November 18, 2024, the City Council conducted a duly noticed public hearing to take public testimony and consider the introduction of this Ordinance to amend <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">San Mateo Municipal Code Chapter 17.10</a> by adopting this Ordinance.</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
